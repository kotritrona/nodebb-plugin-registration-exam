# NodeBB registration exam

version: 0.4.10 | nodeBB compatibility: ~1.12.0

Adds a exam system (/exam) to NodeBB, so new users must pass this exam before they can register an account.

Inspired by some danmaku video website, this plugin can (probably) test out the quality and basic knowledge of your forum topics, which could (hopefully) root out some spam and trolls.
